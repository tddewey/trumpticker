# trumpticker
Flat text file documenting the things Trump has done. Eventually, an API/feed.

# Voice
* This project has a liberal voice. Factual, but not neutral.

## Contribution Guidelines
* One Trump action per line (it's a CSV, afer all)
* If it is a tweet, put the full text of the tweet (in case it is deleted)
* All lines must have a source URL and that URL should be something reasonably reputable
* Any Trump actions are valid, it doesn't have to be just official exeutive orders. If he chokes on a pretzel, we should include it.
* Keep it limited to what Trump has done... but there's some room for creativity there (e.g. "Trump orders so-and-so...") as long as the source URL traces it back to Trump, this can too.
* Newest items on top. Keep the CSV in chronological order
* One event per pull request makes it easy to review.

## Todo
* Create an service to parse the CSV and present it as a feed.
