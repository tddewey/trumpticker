# trumpticker
CSV file documenting the things Trump has done. Eventually, an API/feed.

This project is to create a lightweight register of what he's done for use in art projects, to inspire protest signs, display on a ticker in Times Square, or whatever.

## Voice
* This project has a liberal voice. Factual, but not necessarily neutral.

## Contribution Guidelines
I could use help. The administration is preventing proper discourse and debate and it's difficult to keep up. I will accept and discuss pull requests for new events or spelling issues. Here are some guidelines:

* One Trump action per line (it's a CSV, afer all)
* If it is a tweet, put the full text of the tweet (in case it is deleted)
* All lines must have a source URL and that URL should be a reputable source
* Any Trump actions are valid, it doesn't have to be just official exeutive orders
* Newest items on top. Keep the CSV in chronological order
* One line per pull request makes it easy to review.

## Todo
* Create an service to parse the CSV and present it as a feed.
* Create a website to display the feed and share API/feed usage instructions.
